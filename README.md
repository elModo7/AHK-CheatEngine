# RAM Search & Edit Tool

![Preview](https://github.com/elModo7/AHK-CheatEngine/blob/main/res/preview.gif?raw=true)

This is a basic example in AutoHotkey of a tool resembling [CheatEngine](https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine)'s main read/write memory functions.
It is very basic but covers a few of the most common ram searches.


> [!CAUTION]
> In the case that you use this for a game, **use it for offline games**, *I am not responsible for any misuse of this tool.* It is also very likely that it may be flagged by anticheats if you target a game process.


> [!NOTE] 
> Remember that AutoHotkey is a **slow** interpreted programming language, the class however with no aditional code, is able to do around **~300.000 RAM reads per second** on an Intel core i7 8700K.
> AHK-L v1 also **lacks multithread support**, so if you want a lightning-fast alternative consider using a compiled language solution.
